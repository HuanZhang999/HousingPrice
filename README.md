House Prices: Advanced Regression TechniquesÂ¶

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The pipeline of this project is as following:

a) Data cleaning and formatting (Exploratory data analysis)

b) Feature engineering and selection

c) Establish a baseline and compare several machine learning models on a performance metric

d) Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model to optimize it for the problem

e) Evaluate the best model on the testing set

d) Interpret the model results and make predictions

In this project I explored different machine learning methods for regression problem, including Linear Regression,
Support Vector Machine Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression. 
The best result was from Gradient Boosting model.
